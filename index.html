    <h2>James Ang</h2>
    <h3>BS Management Engineering, Ateneo de Manila University</h3>
    <p>To be completely honest, I attended ACSC 2017 not expecting much for it. The ACSC applications happened just a few months before the applications for that year’s college entrance tests and for me, this event was nothing more than an opportunity to get a glimpse of the culture in Ateneo and MEA. Little did I know that this experience would drastically change the way I perceive business. The event made me realise that rather than being just a medium to make money, business is an opportunity to make a positive impact on our society and environment. The thing I believe sets ACSC apart is how intentional every part of it is. From the talks to the activities, every single part of the experience was well thought of and serves a purpose. They are simple enough that I, who knew nothing about corporate sustainability, was able to understand, but also thorough enough that the whole ACSC experience was still able to leave a lasting impact on me and my fellow participants. All these things plus the wonderful people I met are what made my ACSC experience memorable enough for me to apply again the following year for ACSC 2018, and this year as a Programs core member!</p>
